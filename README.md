# busRouteFinder
This is my (incomplete) project for HackTJ 7.5.
Before running, make sure to download Flask into the directory you're using. I had trouble importing the entirety of the venv folder -- you're probably better off just installing the flask virtual environment again on your own (delete the existing venv folder), which will give you a new virtual environment.
This project also uses data and code from the Eastbanc Technologies transitIQ API.
